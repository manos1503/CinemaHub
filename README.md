# CinemaHub 🎬

CinemaHub is a movie comparison web app that helps you discover movies by making quick choices.

You start with a **Sign Up / Log In** page. After logging in, the main app shows **two movies at a time**. You pick the movie you like more, and the movie you *didn’t* choose is replaced with a new one — so you can keep comparing nonstop.

## How it works

1. **Sign Up / Log In**
   - Create an account or log into an existing one.
2. **Compare movies**
   - The app shows **Movie A vs Movie B**
   - Click the movie you prefer
3. **Continuous recommendations**
   - The chosen movie stays
   - The unchosen movie is replaced by another movie
   - Repeat and keep discovering new movies
